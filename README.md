### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Nenad Manev
from Skopje,Macedonia. 

Extremely motivated to constantly work on myself and grow professionally. I have great experience working in a team environment, as well as independently.
Working as a freelancer I learn how to work under pressure, to be pragmatic, explore new technologies by myself and make decisions for new implementation. My goal is to be a solution architect. That's why Iâ€™m very passionate about building new solutions from scratch and want to be actively involved in the solution design process and decision making.
Web development is my passion where currently, I have almost six years of experience.
